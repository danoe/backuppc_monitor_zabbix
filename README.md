# Monitoring Backuppc with Zabbix

This is based on script found in thread https://www.zabbix.com/forum/showthread.php?t=17273

Tested with Zabbix 4.0 (http://www.zabbix.com/) and Backuppc v3 (http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/).

## Debian Package Build
    fakeroot dpkg-deb --build src/ .
    

## Manual Install

Add a line from 'sudo' file to your sudo config

    cp etc/sudoers.d/zabbix-backuppc /etc/sudoers.d/zabbix-backuppc
    
Copy 'zabbix-backuppc.pl' and 'zabbix-discover-backuppc.pl' to '/usr/bin'

    cp usr/bin/*.pl /usr/bin
    
Make it executable with backuppc user

    chmod +x /usr/bin/*.pl
    
You need to have in Zabbix agent config

    'EnableRemoteCommands=1' 
    
Import template into Zabbix and configure it:

    zabbix-templates/zabbix-backuppc-template.xml
